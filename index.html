            Self-importance requires spending most of one's life offended by
            something or someone.

            The trick is in what one emphasizes. We either make ourselves
            miserable, or we make ourselves happy. The amount of work is the
            same.

            It is a waste of energy when we try to conform to a pattern. To
            conserve energy, we must be aware of how we dissipate energy.

            The ego is like a tired old dog. We can never kill it, so put it out
            on the back porch, let it rest there, and step around it.

            Feeling important makes one heavy, clumsy and vain. To be a warrior
            one needs to be light and fluid.

            The more you know yourself, the more clarity there is.
            Self-knowledge has no end - you don't achieve, you don't come to a
            conclusion.

          <h3>Chef</h3>
          <p>
            Freedom is not a reaction; freedom is not choice. It is manâ€™s
            pretence that because he has choice he is free. Freedom is pure
            observation without direction, without fear of punishment and
            reward. Freedom is without motive; freedom is not at the end of the
            evolution of man but lies in the first step of his existence. In
            observation one begins to discover the lack of freedom.

          <h3>Doctor</h3>
          <p>
            Thought is time. Thought is born of experience and knowledge, which
            are inseparable from time and the past. Time is the psychological
            enemy of man. Our action is based on knowledge and therefore time,
            so man is always a slave to the past. Thought is ever limited and so
            we live in constant conflict and struggle. When man becomes aware of
            the movement of his own thoughts, he will see the division between
            the thinker and thought. He will discover that this division is an
            illusion.
